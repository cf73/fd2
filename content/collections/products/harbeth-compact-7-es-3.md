        text: "The Harbeth secret for accuracy and lifelike sound is the meticulous attention to detail during the design stage. Critically important, but hidden, is the crossover, which carefully integrates the drive units across a wider horizontal and vertical arc. Incremental changes to this fundamental component have allowed this legendary loudspeaker to present the most challenging instruments with increased presence and transparency.\_\_"

    review_text: |-
      It’s very appropriate that the Harbeth Compact 7ES-3 XD speakers are distributed in Australia by Audio Magic, because these are magic-sounding speakers indeed! The midrange is truly miraculous, the level of bass from such a small cabinet/driver combo is magical, and the way the speakers reveal the highest treble sounds without etching it is also clever. 

      But by far the biggest trick these speakers pull off is making you think you’re listening to the real thing. Amazing
