        text: 'Gordian combines a powerful industrial grade power analyzer, a smart and adaptive power line conditioner, a power factor corrector and a robust power distributor. It aims at providing valuable information about our main power supply quality and gently improving the quality of our system’s power without affecting the positive characteristics of our system (e.g. dynamics)'

        text: 'Every single component in high-end audio system depends on a pure and potent power source, where the seamless transfer of electric energy flow is, of course, mandatory. Only in this way can a system serve the complete auditory range without affecting any particular frequency or introducing ground loops.'

    review_text: |-
      There’s not really a lot to say about the unit in all honesty other than this reduction in the overall “noise” on the line and the sense of you being able to hear more detail and more of what is going on in the track with a “cleaner” sound overall. I could warble on about a whole host of tracks that I listened to but the effect of gordian in the system remained constantly positive and consistent and so I see little point in doing this.
