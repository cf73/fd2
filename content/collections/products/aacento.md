        text: 'Thanks to the cooperation with Airtech laboratories to develop Anniversary line, some key points and ideas in the design have been shared also in this new line and differently by the Anniversary line products, where each model is created to make in the best way only what it is created to do, in PureAA line the target is also to make products with more features in order to get the interest of those users looking for a wider range of functions and connections concentrated in a single product. This is easy to understand looking at below features description, as it is easy to understand that everything was made with extreme care and no compromise solutions almost impossible to find in products of the same category and price range'

    review_text: '“Vocals are simply sumptuous. The AAcento’s mid-band mastery allows each voice to be distinct, yet the subtle blend of the three together is richly textured yet entirely cohesive… the AAcento reveals subtle acoustic atmospheres that other amplifiers can only hint at.”'
