    review_text: 'I’ve owned a lot of speakers, both big and small, and it’s rare that I find one so engaging and musical, so at home with all types of music. This is a speaker that makes you excited about listening to music, makes you want to hear as much as possible and offers a connection to the artist that you don’t always find easily. The 30.2 XD is not just a speaker that I want to listen to music on, it’s a speaker that I want to live with, so much so, I put my money where my editorial mouth is and sent the distributor a check. Hats off to Shaw and co for producing a world class musical product.'
