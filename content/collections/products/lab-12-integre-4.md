      The best reason to fall in love with the Lab12 Integre4, that sound. For the few months I had the Integre4, I was happy with my reference system. Incredibly so. These were days of memorable listening sessions, rather than time spent at work figuring out how to make things sound better. I can’t think of anything else to say about this sublime little amplifier. Highly recommended, as well as desired.
