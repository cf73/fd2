      The pricing on this amplifier is, frankly, stupid. No, that is not really fair, is it? I’m better off saying that the asking price for this amplifier represents a bit of a bargain and I’ve heard valve amplifiers, and solid-state amps for that matter that cost a lot more than this not have the same sense of power and control that the Suana brings to the party.
