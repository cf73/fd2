        text: 'The IOTA incorporates the implementation of radical and unorthodox thinking in order to offer the same integrity and musical capability that distinguishes all Neat loudspeakers. It is especially suited to the current crop of all-in-one streaming systems, from which a very high level of sound quality can be attained, but space is usually at a premium.'
