    review_text: 'Vocals are transcendent with the Heretics, both in terms of tonality and the way they can decode layered harmonies. The Heretics are highly natural in their presentation, and again thanks to the high sensitivity, nothing is ever working hard to produce sound – resulting in low distortion and fatigue. These are speakers you can listen to all day without becoming the least bit tired.'

        text: 'Forget “hard to drive” speakers. Heretic loudspeakers are engineered to work with all amplifiers, including highquality, low power, “tube” amplifiers. Sensitivity rating of 97 dB @ 2,83V and non-inductive tuning means that most of the time, your Heretics will be perfectly happy with less than 1 watt of power.'
