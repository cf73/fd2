        text: '20 years of Audio Analogue, 20 years of Puccini, the two things go hand in hand ... the Puccini, the first amplifier and the first Audio Analogue product and absolute milestone of high fidelity audio. The dream was to create the best Puccini ever, a product that would mark a turning point in the history of Audio Analogue and show the way for what will be the products of the future, created with the intention of giving top sound performances, but also technically very advanced. This is certainly a tall order and to make it possible we have seen the consolidation of an idea born in the Airtech laboratories: development of an integrated amplifier without global feedback, being this way less sensible to the kind of load driven, without the tendence to oscillate, without high frequency resonance peaks, with no saturation in the input stages and with completely balanced circuitry.'

    review_text: 'What is beyond a doubt is that the Puccini Anniversary keeps your speakers under strict control. It uses its power to ensure they start and stop in a precise manner, and thus enhances their ability to image and focus a soundstage, while at the same time keeping rhythm sections as tight as they are rich.'
