        text: 'This elegant new design uses the configuration first exploited in the prestige Neat Ultimatum XL6 loudspeaker. The top section is sealed off from the lower, and incorporates two sealed chambers, operating as a two-way infinite baffle loudspeaker. A 50mm ribbon-type tweeter and 134mm bass/midrange unit are both mounted on a specially profiled sub-baffle, attached to the main cabinet via a de-coupling polyethylene membrane.'

        text: 'Iso-baric loading allows deep, well controlled LF performance from a compact enclosure. This system takes great skill to execute correctly, and the very successful implementation in several of our other models means that we can approach this new design with confidence.'

        text: 'The EKSTRA is very slim, at 17cm wide, and 110cm tall. The footprint is exceptionally small, so it can be positioned in very tight situations if required.'

        text: 'Combining these elements ensures that the EKSTRA delivers a compelling portrayal of all types of music. Like many Neat models, it delivers a full-bodied and agile presentation with a huge soundstage, which projects far beyond the modest confines of the cabinet.'

        text: 'The tweeter is a ribbon type which delivers tremendous dynamic expression without compression. The bass/mid drive unit has also been used in the award-winning Neat Motive and Iota Alpha models. It has a treated paper cone with a flared profile. The carefully-judged crossover network allows superb integration of these units'

        text: 'The lower, ported, section of the EKSTRA houses not one, but two of the 134mm bass drive units. One unit is located on the bottom panel, facing the floor, whilst the second is located internally, directly above the first, in a sealed iso-baric arrangement, handling only low frequencies and acting as an integral subwoofer system. The low-Q port is specially tuned to enable close to wall placement of the speaker in most rooms.'

      Neat Acoustics Ekstra’s tagline is ‘Thinking Inside The Box’ and while that is absolutely correct, it’s so much more than that. Ekstra is a loudspeaker that does manage to squeeze a quart into a pint pot and does it perfectly. You need to be fairly well in lockstep with the sound of Neat (put another way, the sound Bob from Neat likes), but if that is the case, the Ekstra will melt your heart, extra fast.
