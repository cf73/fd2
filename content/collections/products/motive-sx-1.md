        text: 'This loudspeaker uses a two and half-way configuration, with the bass/midrange driver and the tweeter operating within a sealed enclosure. The sub-bass drive unit is housed separately in a reflex-tuned section below. The bass reflex port is fitted to the bottom panel of the cabinet and is vented through an outlet in the stylishly sculpted MDF plinth.'

        text: 'The tweeter is the new and upgraded unit used throughout the Motive SX range and features a huge screened magnet assembly and a 25mm inverted anodised aluminium dome. This type of tweeter is usually only found in more expensive high-end loudspeakers and is therefore an exceptional inclusion to the Motive SX designs.'
