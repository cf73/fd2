      The pre1 is a wonderful preamp with a sublime volume control. It offers an open window on the music and the beautiful soundstage comes for free. If you can live with the limited features, with the Lab12 pre1 and dac1 reference you have two absolute winners. They are, to use a cliché, highly recommended!
