      I played the unit for a week casually as the integre4 was factory fresh. Out of the box, you’ll be enjoying a fine tube design and recognizing typical, lovely tube signposts in its playback. A week of heavy use yields significant improvements, so, please be patient. Quality out of the box, yes, but the extra time benefits bass definition and overall refinement. The unit is shipped with a standard IEC power cord but the company’s cutely-named ‘knack’ mk2 Power Cable which accompanied the review unit looked beefy and classy. A nice match aesthetically to the integre4. I used it for the majority of the listening period, and yes, it was bump in performance over the standard IEC
