        text: 'This is where it all started for Lab12. Our love for music, for high-end audio and our exploration for many years, gave us a huge challenge when designing a headphone preamplifier that met our demand to deliver a faultless sonic signature. Dealing with the sensitive signal output and transforming it into a true high-end audio headphone amplifier is not a task that everyone would dare to explore, but for Lab12 it is one we could not resist.'
