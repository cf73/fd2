        text: 'These are BIG speakers. If you have the space, buy them. If you do not have the space, get the AD614, same transducers. If you do have the space, AD612 air volume will bring almost an octave more in bandwidth, all with complete ease with incredible power. The membrane will not move. You will never need more, this is my promise.'
