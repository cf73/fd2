introtext: 'ABsolute... the essence of this integrated amplifier is perfectly revealed in its name. The most ambitious project of Audio Analogue after over 25 years of history and certainly the best way to celebrate such an important anniversary. A unique amplifier that gives the opportunity to enjoy the refinement of pure class A sound or the power of class AB simply touching a button. Audiograde components of the highest level and selected to optimize the performance of the amplifier in both modes of use. Massive shapes, which combine the cleanliness and elegance of the design to an extreme solidity, characterized by the heavy heatsinks machined from solid, which in addition to being unique pieces are a perfect example of the excellence of Made in Italy craftsmanship. Powerful, versatile, refined, extremely musical... all this is Absolute, an amplifier that creates a new reference in the world of high-end high-fidelity.'
