They present near perfect frequency response and overall sonics. The bottom end is right on the money. These are speakers that can work in virtually any size room, large or small.'

        text: 'We have a great deal of experience using monitoring loudspeakers from a number of pro-sound & pro-studio manufacturers. We don’t know how Harbeth does it. Somehow the 40.2s express all the transient response and dynamics we know are on the master recordings and they sound like when we recorded the instruments and vocals; like real music. You just don’t get that with other monitors, which tend to make music sound the same in many respects: Lots of “wow” but not really how the music truly sounds.'
