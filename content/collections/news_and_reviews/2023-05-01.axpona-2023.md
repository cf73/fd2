        text: 'The attendance was brisk and the sound in our rooms was truly outstanding! Our reference 40.3 XD loudspeakers coupled to outstanding electronics from JMF and Ideon provided our listeners with an immersive experience. In the Geoff Poor room the Compact 7 and Monitor 30s proved again that the BBC studio monitors have evolved with the times thanks to the care of Alan Shaw.'
